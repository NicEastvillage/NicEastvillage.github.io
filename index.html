        href="https://homes.cs.aau.dk/~srba/">Jiri Srba</a>. My research focus on using dynamic programming and
    abstractions for <em>Model Checking</em> of <em>timed automata</em> and <em>Petri net</em>, but my interests also
    include <em>game development</em>, <em>programming languages</em>, and <em>AI</em>. In my spare time, I moderate
    and make bots in the <a href="https://rlbot.org/">Rocket League bot community</a> among other nerdy things.

            Abstract
        </summary>
        We propose a novel state-space reduction framework to improve the performance of model checking of Petri
        nets. We provide two instances of the framework: a static technique that considers only the structure of the
        net, and a dynamic technique that additionally considers the current marking. By analyzing impossible, visible,
        and directional effects of transitions, we identify places where tokens can be removed while preserving the
        property in question. Unlike structural reductions, our techniques modify only the current marking, allowing the
        net structure to be reused in multiple subproblems concurrently, which can be beneficial for example for CTL
        model checking. We prove the correctness of our techniques and implement them in the open-source tool Tapaal, a
        repeated winner in the CTL category in the annual model checking contest (MCC). We measure our methods’
        performance on the MCC 2023 benchmark using the CTL categories and demonstrate that our methods reduce time and,
        especially, memory usage. Our dynamic method explores 39.3% fewer configurations on average and achieves two
        orders of magnitude speedup on at least one query on 23.7% of non-trivial models.
