{{ abstract = '''We present CGAAL, our efficient on-the-fly model checker for alternating-time temporal logic (ATL)
on concurrent game structures (CGS). We present how our tool encodes ATL as extended dependency graphs with negation
edges and employs the distributed on-the-fly algorithm by Dalsgaard et al. Our tool offers multiple novel search
strategies for the algorithm, including DHS which is inspired by PageRank and uses the in-degree of configurations
as a heuristic, IHS which estimates instability of assignment values, and LPS which estimates the distance to a state
satisfying the constituent property using linear programming. CGS are input using our modelling language LCGS, where
composition and synchronisation are easily described. We prove the correctness of our encoding, and our experiments
show that our tool CGAAL is often one to three orders of magnitude faster than the popular tool PRISM-games on case
studies from PRISM's documentation and among case studies we have developed. In our evaluation, we also compare and
evaluate our search strategies, and find that our custom search strategies are often significantly faster than the
usual breadth-first and depth-first search strategies.''' }}
