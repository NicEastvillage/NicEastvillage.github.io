{{ abstract = '''Abstractions, such as extrapolation, ensure the termination of timed automata model checking.
However, such methods are normally only defined for classical timed automata, whereas modern tools like Uppaal take
as input timed automata extended with discrete data and C-like language constructs (XTA) making classical
extrapolation excessively over-approximating if even applicable. In this paper, we propose a new dynamic extrapolation
technique for XTAs that utilizes information from the immediate state of the search to find more precise extrapolation
values. We determine which code snippets are relevant to obtain the extrapolation values ahead of verification
using static analysis and then execute these dynamically during verification. We implement our novel extrapolation
technique in Uppaal and find that it reduces the zone graph sizes by 34.7% overall compared to a classic
location-clock-based extrapolation. The best case is an 82.7% reduction and the worst case is a surprising 8.2%
increase.''' }}
